### Endpoint

api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=houston&appid=569b83e02c16eca2296eee261eebaa02

Just console logging the data you need. This can be harder than it sounds.  And as we experienced in our last session,  it’s even harder when use the console logs in chrome. This is where postman comes in. I know you mentioned that you would prefer to write  code to check things, and you will. This is just a tool to assist you. Below I have an attached a video to show you the basics.

Here is your challenge for until the next time we meet.

- Watch the video to get an overview of post man.
- Use the knowledge you gained from the video to get the following data from this endpoint.
- The Current temp
- humidity
- Description
- Icon

    1. I will provide the proper api, endpoint and api key.
    2. This Is a very important part of planning a project. Choosing the correct api/endpoint for what we need is critical, and it is a skill that needs to be practiced.
    3. I’ll have another activity for you to research  a new endpoint if you haven’t already.

1. Once you have the data, assign the data to the following variables.

const currentTemp =
humidity, ect..

Extra challenges. (If there is time)

- Can you find a way to use units that used in the US?
- How could you get a five day forecast (keep in mind that there is a key that gives the time and date. Ex "dt_txt": "2023-12-30 15:00:00")
        - This is a big challenge
        - Consider using a for loop and if conditions
